# sieze-the-CARP

This my course challenge #5, in which I will be modifying the given starter code to flesh out a day planner using the moment.js and jQuery library.

Having to adjust every piece of syntax I had learned in the last challenge and use jQuery for this seemed like cruel and unusual punishment. I spent an obscene amount of time figuring out how to make this work using jQuery in lieu of Vanilla JS... time that could have been spent reviewing material that would be pertinent for the upcoming project week.

After discovering and learning about tempalte strings of my own research in the last challenge, I decided to use them again to simplify the process of getting through this and allow me not to have to create an excessive amount of elements in the HTML. This also caused a neccesity to dig deeper into understanding jQuery and its syntax...
